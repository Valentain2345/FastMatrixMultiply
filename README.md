# FastMatrixMultiply

Very Fast algortihm to multiply matrices, I believe i has quadratic time, but I am not sure at all. The file commited has comments in spanish, sorry for that. 
It comes with a tester in the main method at the end and start with a matrix of 1000x1000

Hopefully is useful to anyone who want to multiply very large matrices.
I want to develop this same code in many programming languages, but for now is only on java.
